# Travel Perfect (Capstone-Project)
Are you going on an exotic trip? Or maybe a short city trip? Do you feel overwhelmed with packing your belongings? Are you anxious until you arrive at your destination, in case you forgot something? No more! With travel perfect, even the beginning of the trip is relaxing. It will not only help you organise, but also remind you when you should be leaving, last minute check to be sure you didnâ€™t forget your toothbrush and assist you packing.

## Why?
The most stressful moments during a trip are at the start and at the end. You are afraid of missing your train/plane and asking yourself if you packed everything needed. Well no more. This app provides a compact way to organise a trip to never forget anything at home.


## How to build
To be able to build this project, two configurations have to be made:
* The Places API key. You can get your own from [here](https://developers.google.com/places/android-api/)
	```groovy
	android {
		defaultConfig {
			resValue "string", "places_api_key", "PLACES_API_KEY"
		}
	}
	```
* The signing config for release and beta builds
	```groovy
		android {
			signingConfigs {
					config {
						keyAlias ''
						keyPassword ''
						storeFile <file_to_keystore_file>
						storePassword ''
					}
			}
    }
	```
